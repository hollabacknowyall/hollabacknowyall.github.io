	<p>Why are dogs my favorite????? HAVE YOU SEEN DOGS BEFORE?! They are like the cutest little things in existence. If you haven't pet a dog, you havent truly lived. If you get the right dog that
	loves being pet, its like havng a literal living stuffie. They're so soft and fluffy and they just love you no matter what's going on and they are just so precious. Truly the best.</p>
