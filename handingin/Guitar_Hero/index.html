	<p>I shouldn't even have to explain why Guitar Hero is amazing, because you should already know. It was a revolutionary game, allowing those lazy gamers who didn't want to take
	time to learn guitar play like a pro. I was one of those lazy gamers, and I have to say, nothing made you feel more awesome than absolutely acing a song on hard mode. I mean, even
	my dad enjoyed playing this game with me. It was truly a family experience.</p>

	<p>I personally had Guitar Hero World Tour, and to be honest, thats all I remember for around two years of my life. I aint even mad either, it was a great time. I would come home and completely destroy a song, and be proud that I was one song closer
	to defeating each song on the game in every single mode. I never did beat expert mode, but I did beat it in Rockband 3, which sucked btw. Rockband is pretty much trash compared to 
	Guitar Hero. If someone tells you, hey, you should play rockband with me, you should slap them in the face and tell them to get real and get Guitar Hero.</p>
	
	<p>I'm kidding don't hit people.</p>
	
	<p>Unless they're stupid. Then make sure its open hand and powerful</p>
