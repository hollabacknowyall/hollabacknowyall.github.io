	<h1>Why Supernatural Is The Best Show I Have Ever Witnessed.</h1>

	<p>If you have ever watched an episode of Supernatural, you will understand what I mean when I say this show is the best.
	When I first started watching this show I could feel my soul literally slipping away. Jensen and Jared are just yum, and I mean having Castiel there certainly doesn't make the situation any worse. 
	I love the show in general; Especially the ever growing storyline with characters who come and go like the seasons. It definitely keeps you on your toes.
	Truely beautiful. </p>
	
	<p>It's even rated 8.6 stars out of 10 on<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460681/"> IMDb</a>, and a ten out of ten in my heart. If you are ever looking for a show to watch in your spare times that will possibly make you have nightmares once in a while, and keep you on your toes, this is it.
	I would put a link in here to watch supernatural online but they dont seem to have one besides on Netflix. Go ahead and check it out sometime. It's amazing I promise. </p>
